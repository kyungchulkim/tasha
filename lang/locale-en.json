      ,"content-p-1" : "TEMCO is developing a blockchain based supply chain management platform. By using blockchain technology, isolated supply chain systems are connected under one platform. Based on the data stored in blockchain, TEMCO offers a business intelligence tool for companies to make better strategic decisions. For consumers, TEMCO provides real-time supply chain information and an ecommerce platform with cryptocurrency payment feature."
      ,"content-h2-2" : "Why blockchain technology for supply chain network?"
      ,"content-p-2" : "Existing supply chain management systems are siloed, and information is disconnected among supply chain participants. To solve this problem, TEMCO is taking advantage of blockchain technology to connect every participant under one platform from manufacturing to final consumers."

      ,"content-p-3" : "Partnering with Nenia, a producer/retailer of eco-friendly organic products, TEMCO linked all the information from the initial production stage to final delivery step in blockchain. The TEMCO platform enables Nenia to depart from their siloed systems and to benefit from efficient data management and higher customer satisfaction."
      ,"content-p-3-1" : "Nenia uses an ERP system for product management. Due to the isolated nature of ERP systems, connecting entire supply chain process is difficult to determine where the problems occur at each stage. In case of any problem, using the existing system is difficult to find and validate where and how the problem originated. Also, consumers were not able to realize and appreciate the company’s eco-friendly, organic value proposition. By using TEMCO platform, Nenia acquired transparency of their supply chain network and that information was also made available to consumers."

      ,"content-h2-4" : "Nenia’s current system & opportunities"
      ,"content-p-4" : "Nenia was ideal for the use case study because the company is directly responsible for the entire supply chain process from purchasing of organic ingredients to delivery of the products at retail stores. However, under the current system, it was not easy to communicate eco-friendly image to consumers. To strengthen Nenia’s unique value proposition, TEMCO suggested blockchain technology that allows all supply chain participants to access each product’s journey to final consumers."
