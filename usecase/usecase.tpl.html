				TEMCO’s business operation 
			</h2>
			<p>
				TEMCO is developing a blockchain based supply chain management platform. By using blockchain technology, segregated supply chain network is connected under one platform. Utilizing the data stored in the blockchain, TEMCO offers an analytics tool for businesses to make better strategic decisions on their supply chain management processes. For consumers, TEMCO provides real-time supply chain management information and an ecommerce platform with cryptocurrency transaction capabilities. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>
				Why TEMCO applied blockchain technology on supply chain network?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Existing supply chain management system is siloed, and information is disconnected among supply chain participants. To solve this problem, TEMCO is taking advantage of the blockchain technology to connect every participant under one platform from manufacturing to final consumers.

				About the case study
			</h2>
			<p>
				Partnering with Nenia, a producer/retailer of eco-friendly organic food, TEMCO linked all the information from the initial product production stage to final delivery step using blockchain. The TEMCO platform enables Nenia to depart from their siloed systems and to benefit from efficient data management and higher customer satisfaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nenia uses an ERP system for product management. Due to the nature of ERP being individualized and isolated, the connection of entire supply chain process is not smooth enough to determine where the problems occur at each stage. In a case of any problems, using the existing system is difficult to find and validate where and how the problem originated. Also, consumers were not able to realize and appreciate the company’s eco-friendly organic product value proposition. By using TEMCO platform, Nenia acquired transparency of their supply chain network and such information was also made available to consumers.

			Nenia’s current system & opportunities
		</h2>
		<p>
			Nenia was ideal for the use case study because the company is directly responsible for the entire process from purchasing of organic ingredients to arrival of the products at a retail store. However, under the current system, it was not easy to gain connected supply chain information and deliver eco-friendly image to consumers. To strengthen the competitiveness of Nenia’s specialty, TEMCO suggested blockchain technology that allows all the participants of the supply chain to access the journey of Nenia's products.

			Potential benefits using TEMCO platform
		</h2>
		<p>
			Manufactures can now understand where and how their products are transferred all at once. Blockchain based supply chain network informs where the problems occurred, and participants can quickly find out how to solve the problems. In addition, manufacturers can check the storage condition through TEMCO’s application regardless of the place. Through blockchain based supply chain network, the manufacturer can maintain the high quality of the products and communicate with the responsible party to address any issues or problems. Through such effort, businesses will gain consumer’s trust by offering higher quality products.
		</p>
		<p>
			TEMCO’s vendor application will simplify the process of uploading data. The application is also easy to use as well, it can be used by anyone. By using the application, no manual entry is needed, reducing any human errors. With the innovation of blockchain and IoT technology, information can be automatically entered and thus, eliminate redundancy of manual input and validation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Until now, accessing product information and supply chain data was difficult. However, scanning the QR code through TEMCO’s consumer application will not only show basic product information, but also raw ingredients used, manufacture information, distribution records and shipping data. This complete connection of all data will reduce the barrier in purchasing and will eventually lead to higher customer satisfaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			More information about products are available through TEMCO’s consumer application, and this will increase the probability of consumer purchases. Businesses like Nenia can benefit greatly from the TEMCO platform, gaining consumer loyalty and brand awareness.
